== Legal Frameworks for Open Source
Understanding the differences of proprietary and open source licenses is fundamental to students 
grasping the holistic benefits of open source software. Students need to understand open source
licenses, how they work, and the effects they have on the wider technical ecosystem.
This becomes especially important as they begin to reference and use other open source code.

A good backgrounder for instructors on the legal framework for open source is http://www.rosenlaw.com/oslbook.htm[Rosenlaws ''Open Source Licensing'' handbook]. For a deeper understanding see Resources below.
