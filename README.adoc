== Teaching Open Source Repository

image::images/teachersLearning.jpg[Teachers Learning]

Teaching open source development, methodologies, and culture is a challenge. Finding content to teach it, is even harder. This project gathers the best-of-the-best resources, activities and examples for teaching open source in an educational environment.

When exploring burgeoning subjects such as open source, teachers need to educate themselves and quickly find existing quality content for use in their classroom. This project attempts to solve that opportunity.

.What you will find most useful:
  * Key background readings - don't dig though hundreds of search results
  * Actual projects and activities that are used in real classrooms
  * Sample learning objectives and rubrics
  * Context that explains how and where each of these have been used in the past

=== A guide to what is already out there
Much of the content around what open source is, and how it is done already exists. Instead of rehashing all of this information, this project will act as a central, curated, and organized location that links off to other expert resources. At the same time, it will house teaching-specific resources not found elsewhere. It will establish what is important around open source, what the key topics are, where you can go to learn about these topics, and then dive into real-world teacher/classroom exercises, tools, best practices and grading rubrics.

=== Not a curriculum
To clarify, this is not a curriculum in and of itself. We expect that educators will create their own curricula from this base of content. The content is meant to be 'cherry-picked' or À la cartein order to form a complete curriculum. We expect that teachers and classrooms will each create their own unique directions with the pieces that we provide here.

== Installation
